# jazz-music-player
This music player was built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. As you can tell in the script file, I tried to make this more functional by creating separate functions for playing, pausing, skipping to the next or previous song. I also created a function which allows users to skip around in the song by interacting with the progress bar (standard across all music players). Figuring out the math to calculate the source element for the duration of the song and matching it with the progress bar was a little tricky, but using Math.floor ended up working out.
